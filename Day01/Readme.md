# Introduction to Internet and Web Development

## What is the Internet?

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standardized protocols. It allows for the sharing of information and resources between computers and people all over the world.

## How does the Internet work?

The Internet is a packet-switched network, meaning that data is broken up into small packets and sent between nodes on the network. Each packet is given a header that contains information about its destination and how it should be routed. The packets are then transmitted over the Internet through a series of routers, which are specialized computers that direct the packets to their final destination.

## What is DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers can understand. It is a critical part of the Internet infrastructure, as it allows users to access websites and other online resources using easy-to-remember domain names instead of difficult-to-remember IP addresses.

## What is a Router?

A router is a device that connects multiple networks together and routes traffic between them. It is responsible for directing packets of data to their final destination on the network. Routers are used to connect LANs (Local Area Networks) to the Internet and to each other.

## What is a LAN?

A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network that connects devices in a limited geographical area, such as a home, office building, or school. It is typically a private network, meaning that it is not accessible to the general public.

## Introduction to Web Development

Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a combination of programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as server-side programming languages like PHP and Ruby.

### Frontend Development

Frontend development is the process of building the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the visual elements and interactive features of a website.

### Backend Development

Backend development is the process of building the server-side logic and database integration for a website or web application. It involves using server-side programming languages like PHP and Ruby to create the server-side logic and database integration.

### Database

A database is a collection of organized data that is stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation. Databases are used to store and manage data for websites and web applications.
