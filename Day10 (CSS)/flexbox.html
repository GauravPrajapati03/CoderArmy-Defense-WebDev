    <h1>CSS FlexBox</h1>

    <pre>
        Flexbox is a layout mode in CSS that makes it easy to align and distribute items within a container element, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

        The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (or flex to fill the available space) to best
        fill the available space.

        A flexbox layout consists of a parent element (called the flex container) and one or more child elements (called flex items). The flex items can be laid out in
        either a horizontal row or a vertical column, depending on the value of the flex-direction property.

        Some of the key properties controlling flexbox layouts include:

        - flex-direction: specifies the direction of the flex items (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse).
        - flex-wrap: specifies whether the flex items should wrap to a new line or not (wrap, nowrap).
        - justify-content: specifies how the flex items should be justified within the flex container (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around).
        - align-items: specifies how the flex items should be aligned within the flex container (flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch).
        - align-content: specifies how the flex items should be aligned within the flex container (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around).
        - flex-grow: specifies the amount of space that a flex item should take up within the flex container.
        - flex-shrink: specifies the amount of space that a flex item should take up within the flex container when there is not enough space.
        - flex-basis: specifies the initial main size of a flex item.

        Flexbox is a powerful and flexible layout mode that can be used to create a wide range of layouts, from simple to complex.
        It is well supported in modern browsers and is widely used in web development.
