            <h2>What is Internet?</h2>
            <p>The internet is a huge network that connects millions of computers and devices around the world, allowing
                people to quickly share information, send messages, and access websites from anywhere. It works like a
                giant
                web, linking together smaller networks so that anyone can find and use information, chat with others,
                watch
                videos, or even shop online. The internet makes it easy for people to communicate and find information
                in an
                instant, no matter where they are. <br>
                <b>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each
                    other
                    using standardized protocols.</b> <br>
                Communication is the process of exchanging information between computers and servers on the Internet.

            <h2>What is Computer Network?</h2>
            <p>Computer networking is the way computers and other devices are connected together so they can share
                information, resources, and communicate with each other. It uses wires, cables, or wireless signals to
                link
                devices like computers, smartphones, printers, and more, making tasks like sending emails, sharing
                files,
                and browsing the internet possible. Networking lets many devices work together, keeps information easy
                to
                access, and supports things like chatting online, playing games, or working from different places.</p>

            <h3><u>Types of Networks</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Personal Area Network (PAN)</b>: The smallest network type, designed to connect a few devices
                    within
                    a short range (typically 1 to 10 meters). Examples include Bluetooth connections between phones and
                    wireless earbuds or infrared communication between a TV and remote.</li>
                <li><b>Local Area Network (LAN)</b>: Connects computers within a limited area such as a home, office, or
                    school building. It offers high-speed data transfer and is usually wired or Wi-Fi based. Examples
                    include Wi-Fi networks in homes or offices.</li>
                <li><b>Campus Area Network (CAN)</b>: Larger than a LAN but smaller than a city-wide network. It
                    connects
                    multiple LANs within a limited geographic area like a university campus or company buildings.</li>
                <li><b>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</b>: Covers a larger geographic area like a city or town. MANs
                    are
                    used to connect several LANs within the city. Examples include cable TV networks or city-wide Wi-Fi
                    networks.</li>
                <li><b>Wide Area Network (WAN)</b>: Covers a very large area such as a country or multiple countries.
                    The
                    internet is the largest WAN. WANs use technologies like leased lines and satellite links.</li>
                <li><b>Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)</b>: A LAN that connects devices wirelessly using Wi-Fi
                    technology, enabling mobility within the network area without cables.</li>
                <li><b>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</b>: A secure network that uses public internet infrastructure to
                    connect remote users or sites privately using encryption.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Does Internet Works?</h2>
            <p>The internet works by quickly moving small pieces of data between computers through millions of
                connections
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is split into small packets before sending so it moves efficiently.</li>
                <li>Routers and switches guide those packets from one computer to another along the fastest path.</li>
                <li>Packets travel using special rules called protocols (like TCP/IP) to make sure they arrive
                    correctly.
                </li>
                <li>Web browsers and apps reassemble packets so people see complete websites, images, or messages.</li>
                <li>Everything travels through wires, cables, or wireless signals to connect computers and devices
                    worldwide.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is IP Address?</h2>
            <p>An IP address is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network so it can be identified
                and
                can send or receive data.</p>

            <h3><u>Types and Versions</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>IPv4</b>: Uses 32 bits, appearing as four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Supports
                    over 4 billion addresses but has limitations as more devices connect to the internet.</li>
                <li><b>IPv6</b>: Uses 128 bits, written in eight groups of four hex digits separated by colons (e.g.,
                    2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). Supports a vast number of devices, solving the address
                    shortage problem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><u>Address Types</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Public IP address</b>: Assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and visible on the
                    internet.
                    Used to identify networks online. These can be reached from anywhere on the internet.</li>
                <li><b>Private IP address</b>: Used within a local area network such as a home or office. Not visible
                    from
                    outside the internal network. Examples include 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, and 172.16.x.x ranges.</li>
                <li><b>Static IP address</b>: Does not change; manually assigned and useful for servers and other
                    devices
                    that need consistent identification.</li>
                <li><b>Dynamic IP address</b>: Changes automatically, usually assigned by a DHCP server in private
                    networks
                    or by ISPs on the internet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><u>Addressing Methods</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Unicast</b>: One-to-one communication between two devices. Each message goes from a unique sender
                    to
                    a unique receiver, which is the most common addressing method.</li>
                <li><b>Broadcast</b>: Delivering one packet to all devices in a local network at once—possible only in
                    IPv4
                    (typical address 255.255.255.255).</li>
                <li><b>Multicast</b>: Sends packets from one sender to multiple specific receivers participating in a
                    multicast group (range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255).</li>
                <li><b>Anycast</b>: Sends a packet to the nearest one in a group of receivers, enabling load balancing
                    and
                    minimizing latency for services like DNS.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What is DNS?</h2>
            <p>DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that
                computers can understand.</p>
            <p>It is like the phonebook of the internet that translates human-friendly website names (domain names) into
                IP
                addresses computers use to find those websites.</p>

            <h3><u>How Does DNS Works?</u></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When a user types a website address (like www.example.com) in a browser, the browser first checks
                    its
                    local cache to see if it already knows the IP address.</li>
                <li>If not found, the request goes to a DNS resolver (usually provided by the Internet Service
                    Provider).
                </li>
                <li>The DNS resolver asks a root DNS server which directs it to the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (like
                    .com
                    or .org).</li>
                <li>The TLD server points the resolver to the authoritative DNS server responsible for the domain
                    (example.com).</li>
                <li>The authoritative server returns the IP address of the website.</li>
                <li>The resolver sends the IP address to the user's computer, allowing the browser to connect to the
                    website's server and load the page.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3><u>Key Points</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>DNS eliminates the need to remember complex IP addresses by using easy-to-remember domain names.
                </li>
                <li>It is hierarchical and distributed worldwide to handle the vast number of internet domains, making
                    the
                    system scalable and fast.</li>
                <li>DNS plays a crucial role in web browsing, email delivery, and many other internet services by
                    resolving
                    names to addresses quickly.</li>
                <li>This entire DNS lookup process happens in milliseconds, making internet browsing smooth and
                    efficient.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>What is MAC Address?</h2>
            <p>A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a network
                interface
                controller (NIC) of a device by its manufacturer. It works at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI
                model
                and is used to identify devices within a local network.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It is a 48-bit address usually expressed as six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons
                    or
                    hyphens (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).</li>
                <li>The first half identifies the manufacturer (called Organizationally Unique Identifier - OUI), and
                    the
                    second half identifies the specific device.</li>
                <li>Every network interface (Wi-Fi card, Ethernet port) has its own unique MAC address.</li>
                <li>MAC addresses are permanent in hardware but can sometimes be changed or "spoofed" through software.
                </li>
                <li>Used for communication within a local area network (LAN) to ensure data goes to the correct device.
                </li>
                <li>MAC address is also known as the physical or hardware address, distinguishing it from IP addresses,
                    which are logical network addresses.</li>
            </ul>

            <pre>   *MAC addresses play a crucial role in networking 
by allowing devices to uniquely identify each other
 and communicate effectively on the local network level.</pre>

            <h3><u>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</u></h3>
            <p>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC (hardware)
                address, allowing devices within a local area network (LAN) to communicate with each other.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>What are Ports?</h2>
            <p>A port in computer networking is a virtual communication endpoint used by devices to differentiate
                between
                multiple services or applications running on the same device over a network. Each port is identified by
                a
                unique port number, allowing a computer to manage many simultaneous connections through a single IP
                address
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ports are software-based and managed by the operating system.</li>
                <li>Port numbers range from 0 to 65535 (16-bit number).</li>
                <li>Ports enable routing of data to the correct applications or services on a device</li>
                <li>Working alongside IP addresses, ports help direct network traffic precisely like telephone
                    extensions in
                    a phone system.</li>

        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications, involving both how
            a site looks and how it works behind the scenes.</p>

        <h3>It typically involves three core technologies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</b>: The basic structure and content of web pages.</li>
            <li><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b>: Styling and layout of web pages to make them visually appealing.
            </li>
            <li><b>JavaScript</b>: Programming language to make web pages interactive and dynamic, adding elements like
                forms, animations, and real-time updates.</li>
        </ul>
