# HTML Boilerplate Code

HTML boilerplate code is the basic structure and code that is typically used as a starting point for a web page. It includes the basic tags and elements that are required to create a valid HTML document.

The standard HTML5 boilerplate code is as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>

</html>

The above code is a complete HTML document and is a good starting point for any web page.
<!DOCTYPE html> - This is the document type declaration. It tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5.

<html lang="en"> - This is the root element of the HTML document. The "lang" attribute specifies the language of the document, which in this case is English.

<head> - This element contains metadata about the document.

    <meta charset="UTF-8"> - This sets the character encoding of the document to UTF-8, which is a Unicode character encoding.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> - This sets the width of the page to the width of the device and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0.

    <title>Document</title> - This sets the title of the page, which is displayed in the title bar of the browser.

</head>

<body> - This element contains the content of the HTML document.

    <h1>Hello World</h1> - This is a heading element that displays the text "Hello World".

</body>

</html> - This is the closing tag for the root element of the HTML document.
